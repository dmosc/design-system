# Breakpoints

## support/breakpoints

Breakpoints are based on standard market screen widths. Since our main product is based on mobile, the benchmark breakpoint starts
at **544px (standard phone)**

Breakpoint syntax is integral and concise throughout the library, thus, it is extremely intuitive in terms of implementing it.

| Breakpoint | Syntax   | Description      |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Standard   | **none** | min-width: 544px |
| Medium     | md       | min-width: 768px |
